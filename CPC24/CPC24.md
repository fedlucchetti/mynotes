# CPC 2024 Course Notes

## Monday Sept 9:

### Introduction
- Forward model <-> Inverse model
  - p(y,x,m))p(x,m) : forward model, generative model
  - p(x|y,m): perception or inverse model of a generative model
  - example hierarchical gaussian filter (HGF)
- "Two cultures of Comnoputational Psychiatry" Bennett et al. 2019, JAMA Pys
  - explanation: 
  - ML
  - generative embedding: mixes both above
- inferring synpatic processes:
  - compute neuronal currents: infer EEG and pinpioint deficient neurotransmitter recceptors
  - Useful for clinicians because we have drungs for different receptors
  - e,g, NMDA receptor antibody encephalitis: Brain on Fire (Movie, Book)

### Schizophrenia (Jakob Siemerkus)
- Term coined in Zurich
- schizophrenia: doiagnosis
- psychotic: symptoms
- paranoid is most frequent delusion in SHZ
- psoitive symtoms: added
  - ego boundary separation, telepathy, delusions
- negative symptoms: deleted
  - slow thinking, reduced social drive
- overlapping syndroms: depression
- symptoms categories:
  - motor: excessive repetitive movements
  - disorganization: speech
  - positive-negative
  - mood
  - cognition: memory, processing speed, cog. deficits
    - preceed positive symptoms
- diagnosis: (DSM 5)
  - at least 2 symptoms should be present during 1 month
- course of SHZ
  - attach plot [figures/course_shz.png]
  - risk factors, dependent accross lifespan
    - genetic
    - malnutrition, trauma
    - migration
    - urban rearing
    - later drug abuse, stress
    - adulthood: untreated psychosis leads to chronic-> SHZ
- Dopamine Hypothesis
  - D2 blocker attenuates thes symptoms  (chlozapine)
  - too much dopamine between midbrain to limbal system
  - too less dopamine in  mesocortical 
- Genetic factors:
  - see Figures 
  - glutamate & cholinergic signaling
- new drug : xanomeline
- Dysconnection hypothesis
  - see figure
- Lost years by Bas Labruyere
- "When the world becomes ‘too real’: a Bayesian explanation of autistic perception"
  - [REF] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661312002008)

### Depression
- depression <-> mania, normal is inbetween these two extremes
- myths about depression
- winston churchil and the black dog
